# SystemOptimization

## Introduction
This is a project taken from the course 'System Optimization' at DTU, between 3 collaborative students. The project coded in Java and together with the report has been copied, to present it in my portfolio. Hope you enjoy :)

## 
The pdf-file 'System_Optimization_Report' contains the report of the project, which will take you through the different algorithms used together with different experiments to find optimal solutions to the problem. To run the code, run the file 'MainInterface.java' in the src folder. It is also there other test files can be applied.
