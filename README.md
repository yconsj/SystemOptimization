# SystemOptimization

## Introduction
This is a project taken from the course 'System Optimization' at DTU, between 3 collaborative students. The project and report, leaving out names, has been copied here, to present it in my portfolio.

## 
The pdf-file 'System_Optimization_Report' contains the report of the project, which will take you through the entire project. To run the code, run the file 'MainInterface.java' in the src folder. It is also there other test files can be applied.
